    "Skill Gap Analysis":"Non-Negotiable Skills Missing: The candidate lacks demonstrable experience in core non-negotiable skills such as Playwright Automation, Typescript/Java proficiency, and significant experience in software test/quality engineering, indicating a need to acquire proficiency in these areas. Negotiable Skills Missing: While the candidate has some web development experience, the resume does not showcase a deep understanding of BDD principles, CI/CD pipelines and cloud testing which are deemed as 'good to have' for the role. Optional Skills Missing: The candidate lacks experience in optional areas like GraphQL, Client/Server Architecture, Accessibility Testing tools, and performance/chaos testing, that could significantly enhance his profile for this position. Key Upskilling Recommendations: The candidate should prioritize learning Playwright and TypeScript, pursuing courses or certifications in cloud platforms (AWS/Azure) and diving deep into CI/CD/DevOps concepts to bridge the gap.",
