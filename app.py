Technical Skills:

Non-negotiable Skills: Absolutely mandatory skills.

Negotiable Skills: Preferred but not mandatory skills.

Optional Skills: Skills that are nice to have but not critical.

Domain Skills:

Extract all industry-specific skills or knowledge relevant to the job (e.g., business processes, sector expertise, certifications).

Education:

Extract educational qualifications, degrees, certifications, fields of study, institutions, and years of study.

Achievements and Other Information:

Extract awards, recognitions, notable projects, volunteer work, hobbies, and any additional relevant information. This category may be empty if no such information exists.

Similarity Scores:

Calculate similarity scores for each of the following categories:

Technical Skills

Domain Skills

Education

Achievements and Other Information

Additionally, provide detailed similarity scores for the subcategories of technical skills in the JD:
